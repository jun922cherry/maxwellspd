/*
 * Legacy stylesheet (main.css) â€“ retained as a lightweight placeholder.
 *
 * All production styles have been migrated to the new modular structure:
 *   - base.css (reset, variables, typography)
 *   - layout.css (grid & page layout)
 *   - components/* (buttons, panels, chat, modal, log, focus/insight boxes, sliders, forms)
 *
 * The application now loads style/app.css which aggregates the above modules.
 *
 * To prevent conflicts, this file intentionally contains no active rules.
 * If you need new styles, add them to the appropriate component or layout file.
